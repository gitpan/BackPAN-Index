Revision history for Perl module BackPAN::Index

0.42  Sun Dec 30 10:59:38 PST 2012
  Test Fixes
  * Fixed t/types.t on Windows.

  Dist Fixes
  * DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader is no longer needed to build the module.


0.41  Thu Dec 27 04:00:45 PST 2012
  Bug Fixes
  * BackPAN::Index now has a file() method, as documented in BackPAN::Index::File.
  * Changed the default backpan URL for fetching files to http://backpan.perl.org
    rather than the backpan.cpan.org redirect. [rt.cpan.org 68492]

  Test Fixes
  * Tests were downloading an old index.

  Misc
  * The result classes are no longer generated at runtime. Speeds up load time
    and reduces bugs.  This also fixes [rt.cpan.org 82107].
  * Use the same filename for the unpacked index.

  Dist Changes
  * The compatibility Makefile.PL has been removed.  The build process has
    gotten complicated.
  * The bug tracker now points at the correct place.


0.40  Tue, 01 Mar 2011 11:57:38 +1100
  Fixes
  * Using the BackPAN index from gitpan.integra.net which is kept up to date.
  * Make all the primary keys not null to quiet a new DBIx::Class
    warning (and its a good idea).
